# Overview

I am wathcing the lectures from [CS2: Data Structures and Algorithms - Richard Buckland](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE621E25B3BF8B9D1). These are the exercises he suggests or problems I can find to solve. This is all about me getting practice writing the Algorithms while I learn them to hopefully make it more memorable.
